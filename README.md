-- It covers basic numpy required for writing machine learning equations and machine learning equations for Univariate linear regression.
2) Hypothesis, Cost function, Gradient descent equations, feature normalization and R2 score of Multivariate linear regression. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh93jHLlliw&t=694s)
-- It covers mathematical derivation and writing machine learning equations for Multivariate linear regression.
3) Normal equation derivation for linear regression. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woIoRPDxrDc&t=642s)
-- It covers derivation and writing Normal equations for closed formed linear regression.
4) Logistic regression from scratch. It contain sigmoid function, cost function, and gredient descent visualization. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A2TeDLwyHU)
-- It covers intuition, mathametical derivation and writing machine learning equations for logistic regression.
5) Logistic regression with regularization from scratch.
-- It covers writing machine learning equations for Regularization in logistic #regression. It covers intuition, and how regularization aids to avoid Overfitting in the data. It also includes visualization of Lambda showing Overfitting and Underfitting cases using Andrew Ng Coursera dataset in python.
